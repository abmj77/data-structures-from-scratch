# 📚 Data Structures Labs & Project

## 🎯 Goal of This Work:
These labs were developed for the **Data Structures** course and focus on building a practical understanding of fundamental data structures using Java.

The main objective of these projects is to:
- Understand how data structures are implemented internally
- Practice working with nodes, linked structures, and arrays
- Apply stack and queue operations
- Implement trees and binary search trees
- Strengthen problem-solving skills using structured programming

All implementations are written in Java and focus on learning the core concepts rather than using built-in libraries.

---

## ✅ This Work Is Considered Successful If:
- Each Lab is clearly described
- The purpose of each implementation is explained
- The execution steps are provided
- The required tools are listed
- The structure is organized and easy to read
- The explanation is simple and educational

### 🧩 Lab 1 – Linked List (Old & New Versions)

**Description:**  
This lab focuses on implementing a linked list from scratch.  
It includes two versions: an older implementation and a revised version.

**Main Concepts:**
- Node creation
- List interface
- Insert and remove operations
- Traversing a linked structure

**Main Code Files:**
- `Node.java`
- `List.java`
- `LinkedList.java`
- `Lab3_new.java` (new version)
- Supporting test or execution files

---

### 🧪 Lab 2 – List Applications

**Description:**  
This lab builds on the linked list implementation and applies it to solve structured problems.

**Main Concepts:**
- Working with custom list implementations
- Applying list operations in practical scenarios

**Main Code Files:**
- `Lab4.java`
- Supporting list-related classes if required

---

### 📦 Lab 3 – Stack Implementation

**Description:**  
This lab focuses on implementing a stack data structure using a linked list approach.

**Main Concepts:**
- Stack ADT
- Push and Pop operations
- LIFO behavior
- Abstract data type design

**Main Code Files:**
- `StackADT.java`
- `Stack.java`
- `stack_main.java`
- `Node.java`
- `LinkedList.java` (if used)

---

### 🔁 Lab 4 – Queue Implementation

**Description:**  
This lab focuses on implementing a queue using both linked structures and circular arrays.

**Main Concepts:**
- Queue ADT
- Enqueue and Dequeue operations
- FIFO behavior
- Circular array implementation
- Reversing using stack logic (if included)

**Main Code Files:**
- `QueueADT.java`
- `Queue.java`
- `circular_array.java`
- `Reverse.java`
- `Node.java`

---

### 🌳 Lab 5 – Trees (Binary Search Tree)

**Description:**  
This lab introduces tree data structures, specifically the Binary Search Tree (BST).

**Main Concepts:**
- Tree nodes
- BST insertion
- Traversal
- Searching in a tree

**Main Code Files:**
- `BST.java`
- `TNode.java`
- `TestBST.java`
- `TestBST_2.java`

---

## 🚀 Final Project

**Description:**  
A comprehensive project that applies multiple data structure concepts learned during the course.

**Main Code File:**
- `Project.java`

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open the project in any Java IDE (such as IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code).
2. Compile the `.java` files.
3. Run the main test class (for example: `stack_main`, `TestBST`, or `Project`).
4. Observe the output in the console.

## 📌 Requirements

- Java JDK (version 8 or later)
- Any Java IDE or command-line compiler
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming
